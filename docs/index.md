# Infinities in my Brain

## Introduction

Hello! I am a student in mathematics at Louisiana State University. This is my blog, in which I try to write notes on simple topics in mathematics that is dumbed down so that I can understand them. Hopefully you will find them interesting and helpful. I would love to have feedback, so please do not hesitate to contact me. My website is https://sites.google.com/view/sudip-sinha.


## Motivation

It happens quite frequently to me that I understand an idea and later forget it. This makes me keep coming back to the same things over and over again, which became frustrating. So I have decided to write down some of the topics that I understand in my own words, so that I can use these notes to teach myself and others in the future.


## Philosophy

My understanding of mathematics is incremental and based on examples. By this, I mean that I like to see simple examples, and then like to see a generalization of an idea, as opposed to proving an abstract idea and seeing its restriction to simpler cases. I will try to stick to this way in my writings.
