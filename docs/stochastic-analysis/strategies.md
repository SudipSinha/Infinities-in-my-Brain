##  Setup

*   Original equation \( X_t^ε = W_1 + \sqrt{ε} ∫_0^t σ(X_t^ε) \d W_t \) for \( t ∈ [0, 1] \).
*   Method of enlargement of filtration
    -   Enlarged filtration: \( \tilde{ℱ}_t = ℱ_t ∨ σ(W_1) \)
    -   Define \( A_t = ∫_0^t \frac{W_1 - W_u}{1 - u} \d u \)
    -   Then \( W_t = \tilde{W}_t + A_t \), where \( \tilde{W}_⋅ \) is a \( \tilde{ℱ}_⋅ \)-Wiener process.
